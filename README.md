This is a basic NLP Model that is trained on the phrases said by the character GLaDOS from the video game Portal Still Alive. This program creates a cli that allows a user to talk with an AI inspired by GLaDOS. You can talk to GLaDOS about anything, but remember it is GLaDOS. 

NOTE: The characters and video games associated with this project are not owned by me
